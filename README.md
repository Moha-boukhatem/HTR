* **Graduation project for my bachelor's degree (In progress)**


Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) system based on LSTMs & implemented with TensorFlow (TF) and trained on the IAM off-line HTR dataset.
The model takes **images of single words or text lines (multiple words) as input** and **outputs the recognized text**.
